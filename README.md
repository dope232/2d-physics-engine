# 2d-physics-engine

We have implemented a rudimentary 2D physics engine that is capable of simulating basic physical interactions such as collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and forces . The goal is to create a basic system that helps bring realistic physics into games or other interactive projects. This is done as part of our OOAD course, and it provided us a great learning experience on how to use different design patterns, and principles, and how to build and run in an object oriented environment 


## Prerequisites 
- Cmake
- Vcpkg
- use build_again.sh to run if in Linux

Please set DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH as the  vcpkg package's location
